Tests
-----

Run the tests with `npm test` (after you have [set up your local installation](/INSTALL.md)).

For running specific tests only, you can use mocha in a command like
`mocha -R spec test/announcements/` To install mocha, invoke `npm install -g mocha` or `sudo npm install -g mocha` 

To run the style check (jshint) and the tests on every file change, use `grunt watch`

We are using WebStorm as IDE [Webstorm](http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)
