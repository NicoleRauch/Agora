      h3 Format
      p We are an international conference, and the conference language is English. We cordially ask you to  keep all conversations in English, even for colloquial discussions.
      p
        |  The conference starts with a #{''}
        +extlink('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_Cafe', 'World Café')
        |  followed by two days of #{' '}
        +extlink('http://agilecoachcamp.org/tiki-index.php?page=OpenSpace', 'Open Space')
        |  and finishes with a full day of #{''}
        a(href='/wiki/' + (currentYear - 1) + '/sunday-workshops') workshops
        | .
      p.
        Open Space is at the core of what SoCraTes is. Each day starts with
        everybody gathering in the same room and creating the schedule for the
        day. Anybody who wants to grabs a sheet of paper and writes the topic
        they want to add to the schedule. Then the topics are briefly presented
        and assigned to a timeslot and a room. That's it for a start, next come
        the sessions.
      p.
        There are many different kinds of sessions. Some sessions are all about
        discussing the topic in a somewhat chaotic manner where even the
        participants don't know where the session is going to take them. People
        share opinions, ask questions and compare experiences. Not everybody
        needs to share - interest in the topic alone is sufficient. This is a
        great way to learn beyond the book material, to learn how something
        works in the real world from concrete experiences people had in their
        specific contexts.
      p.
        Some sessions express the desire of the person proposing the session to
        learn about a certain topic. In many cases, there will be some
        participants who know the topic well and who are willing to share
        their knowledge.
      p.
        A smaller number of sessions are run as presentations. This can be
        about TDD, Event Sourcing, Functional Programming, a particular
        library, or anything else a talk can be about. There is always time
        left for discussion and answering questions.
      p.
        Quite a few sessions focus on hands-on activities. You want to try a
        new technology?  Or just hack together in a group? You'll certainly
        find people to join you. Some of the hands-on sessions are run like
        workshops, some are done in mob-programming format, some are code
        katas, others are just hacking on an interesting open-source library.
        It can really be anything the group want it to be.
      p.
        And this is the beauty of Open Space - it really will be anything the
        group wants it to be. You are feeling a bit frustrated with something
        at work? How about a therapy session outside in the sun with a few
        like-minded people over a glass of wine or a cup of tea? You have a
        particular question about something you're stuck with? Just ask for
        help. You... get the picture by now. :)
      p.
        And this leads us to...

      h3 People
      p.
        SoCraTes is all about people. There are going to be 200 motivated,
        intelligent and friendly participants, just like yourself, to make the
        best of the time together.
      p.
        You'll have breakfast, lunch and dinner together. Some of the best
        conversations happen over a meal. You'll spend the evenings together in
        a bar, play games together, go for a morning run or a walk together.
        There's definitely going to be a game or 100 of werewolf, fun rounds of
        beach volleyball and much more.
      p.
        We all stay at the same location for the sole reason of having enough
        time with each other - enough time to get to know each other, learn
        from each other, create business contacts, recuperate from the real
        world and have a generally great time. If you've never been to a
        conference like this, it will be an eye-opener. No more divisions
        between speakers and audience, going home alone or being tied to a
        fixed schedule.  Doesn't matter if you're a world-class expert,
        world-weary salary-man, a student, or have just started to program a
        couple of months ago.  Everybody has something to give, to share and to
        learn from others. And all of that happens in a friendly, supportive
        and safe environment that embraces and celebrates diversity.
      p.
        This can sound a bit unusual, but it works beautifully in practice.
        Why? Because so many amazing people are at the same place, focusing on
        each other. By the end of the conference you'll know by name a few
        dozens of new faces. You'll have made friends, business connections if
        you want them, maybe you'll find a mentor, or a kindred spirit for that
        interesting project you want to work on. Anything can happen. And is
        bound to happen.
      p
        | And
        b  that
        |  is what SoCraTes is really all about.
