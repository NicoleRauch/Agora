        You will definitely not only hang around in the meeting rooms. Since we have rented most of the
        facility there will be many places to meet and discuss in a relaxed way. Enjoy the air, the sun, the landscape.

  h3 Rooms
  p.
    Some of the venue's rooms are twin rooms. An important aspect of SoCraTes is
    its closedness where everything happens in the same location. Therefore, we
    can only accept as many participants as there are beds available.
  p.
    When you register, you can let us know whom you'd be willing to share a room with. Even if you don't know
    anybody just yet, we will do all we can to find a suitable roommate for you. After registration you'll be 
    able to access the SoCraTes Wiki, where you can get to know other participants before the conference, share information about Taxi- and 
    Ride sharing and other organisational matters.
