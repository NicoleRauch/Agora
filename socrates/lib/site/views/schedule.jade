          is an approach for hosting meetings, conferences, corporate-style retreats and community summit events, 
          focused on a specific and important purpose or task &ndash; but beginning without any formal agenda, beyond 
          the overall purpose or theme.

      h2 Evening activities
      p
        | In the previous years there were a multitude of things going on in the evenings, from music (some participants 
        | brought instruments, songbooks etc., one year they even wrote a song about the conference) over board games to 
        a(href='https://github.com/janernsting/maexchen') live-hacking programs to play mia against each other
        |. And of course there's always plenty of people to just talk to, or continue discussions from the day.
