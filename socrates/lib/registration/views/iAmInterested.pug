          | , just select the same authentication provider here, and you're done.
        p Otherwise, please select your favourite authentication provider. We then ask you to give us your name and your e-mail address.

        h4 Notification
        p When registration is about to open, we will send you one e-mail to inform you. We might send you another e-mail shortly
          | before SoCraTes takes place (depending on whether there are still spaces available).
          | In each subsequent year, we will send you these e-mails again. If you no longer want to receive these e-mails, you can
          | resign via the option in the user-menu in the upper right corner.
