      h3 Deposit
      p We require you to pay a (non-refundable) deposit of 100 &euro; as soon as you finish your registration. We cannot give you an invoice for this, so you propably will have to pay this from your private money.
      p However, we will return your deposit to you at the conference, and you will of course get an invoice for your full payment.
      p The deposit can be paid in two ways:
      ul.square.outside
        li Via bank transfer to a German bank account
        li Via credit card (an additional fee of 3,30 &euro; will be charged)
      p If you cannot participate in the event, you can provide another participant to substitute you - your deposit can then be counted towards the replacing participant. Please contact us in this case.
